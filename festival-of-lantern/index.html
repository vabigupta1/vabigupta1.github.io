<h2 id="lantern-festivals-and-sustainability">Lantern Festivals and Sustainability</h2>

<p>As lantern festivals continue to gain popularity, there is a growing concern about their impact on the environment. Lanterns made of paper and fabric can pose a fire hazard if not properly managed, and the release of lanterns into the sky can contribute to pollution. Festival organizers are increasingly taking steps to ensure that lantern festivals are more sustainable and eco-friendly.</p>

<p>One approach is the use of biodegradable lanterns made from eco-friendly materials. These lanterns are designed to break down naturally over time, reducing the impact on the environment. Another option is the use of LED lights instead of open flames, which eliminates the risk of fire while still creating a beautiful glow.</p>

<p>Additionally, many festivals now have designated collection points where festival-goers can return their lanterns for proper disposal. This helps prevent littering and ensures that the lanterns are recycled or disposed of in an environmentally responsible manner.</p>
